# The Cooklang Manifesto

Cooking is one of the oldest human skills, yet the way we store and share recipes is broken. Recipes are trapped in ad-ridden websites, locked inside proprietary apps, or written in ways that computers can’t understand. Cooklang is here to change that.

We believe the world would be a better place if:

1. Recipes Were Both Human-Readable and Machine-Readable
A recipe should be easy to write, read, and edit—whether you’re a person or a computer. Plain text, structured yet simple.

2. Cooking Was as Hackable as Code
Cooking is an iterative process. Recipes should be forked, modified, and version-controlled, just like software.

3. Food Data Wasn't Locked in Silos
You should own your recipes, shopping lists, and meal plans. They should work across apps, devices, and platforms, without being tied to a single company.

4. Kitchen Automation Served the User, Not the Other Way Around
Your smart kitchen should work with the tools you choose, not force you into closed ecosystems.

5. Structured Data Unlocks Smarter Cooking
With the right format, recipes can be dynamically adjusted for servings, dietary needs, or ingredient availability—automatically.

6. Recipes Shouldn’t Be Trapped in Blog Posts
Food blogs are great, but recipes should be easily extractable, shareable, and free from distractions.

7. Food Brands Should Embrace Open Formats
Your favorite brands should want you to cook with their ingredients anywhere—not force you into their proprietary app.

8. Cooking Should Be Dynamic, Not Static
Imagine a recipe that adapts in real-time based on what’s in your fridge, your past cooking history, or your dietary goals.

9. Less Time Should Be Spent Transcribing, More Time Cooking
Recipes should be as easy to collect and use as bookmarks—no more manual retyping.

10. Cooking is Creative and Iterative
Every meal is a version update. Your recipe history should reflect your personal evolution as a cook.

We built Cooklang to make this future possible. A simple, open format for writing and sharing recipes, designed for the way people actually cook.

Join us. Cook better. Own your recipes. Build the future of food.
