# The Cooklang Manifesto

Cooking is one of the oldest human skills, yet the way we store and share recipes is broken. Recipes are trapped in ad-ridden websites, locked inside proprietary apps, or written in ways that computers can’t understand. Cooklang is here to change that.

We believe the world would be a better place if:

1. _Recipes Were Both Human-Readable and Machine-Readable_

A recipe should be easy to write, read, and edit—whether you’re a person or a computer. Plain text, structured yet simple.

2. _Cooking Was as Hackable as Code_

Cooking is an iterative process. Recipes should be forked, modified, and version-controlled, just like software.

3. _Food Data Wasn't Locked in Silos_

You should own your recipes, shopping lists, and meal plans. They should work across apps, devices, and platforms, without being tied to a single company.

4. _Kitchen Automation Served the User, Not the Other Way Around_

Your smart kitchen should work with the tools you choose, not force you into closed ecosystems.

5. _Structured Data Unlocks Smarter Cooking_

With the right format, recipes can be dynamically adjusted for servings, dietary needs, or ingredient availability—automatically.

6. _Recipes Shouldn’t Be Trapped in Blog Posts_

Food blogs are great, but recipes should be easily extractable, shareable, and free from distractions.

7. _Food Brands Should Embrace Open Formats_

Your favorite brands should want you to cook with their ingredients anywhere—not force you into their proprietary app.

8. _Cooking Should Be Dynamic, Not Static_

Imagine a recipe that adapts in real-time based on what’s in your fridge, your past cooking history, or your dietary goals.

9. _Less Time Should Be Spent Transcribing, More Time Cooking_

Recipes should be as easy to collect and use as bookmarks—no more manual retyping.

10. _Cooking is Creative and Iterative_

Every meal is a version update. Your recipe history should reflect your personal evolution as a cook.

We built Cooklang to make this future possible. A simple, open format for writing and sharing recipes, designed for the way people actually cook.

Join us. Cook better. Own your recipes. Build the future of food.
